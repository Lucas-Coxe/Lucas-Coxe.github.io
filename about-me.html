      <h1 class="About">Who am I?</h1>

      <p class="description">
        Ever since I was little I have always wanted to innovate. I have always
        been very optimistic and intuitive. I grew up in a rural town with a lot
        of room to play and expand my imagination, I credit a lot of my
        ambitions and dreams to that. I love to spend time outdoors fishing and
        hiking. I also love spending time with my loved ones, after all they
        really help shape who you are. I love to code, it brings me such peace,
        and helps me expand my mind and thoughts.
